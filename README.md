## About this Project
Web application that lets you find the shortest path between two points and generate random mazes.
## Goal for this Project
The goal of this project was to learn about algorithms/DataStructures and testing with jest and @testing-library

## Installation
```
# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the client & server with concurrently
$ npm start


# runs on http://localhost:3000
```

## Technologies
* JS vanilla
* Algorithms/DataStructures
* Jest
* TestingLibrary

## What I learned
I learned how to implement complex algorithms and dataStructures using js vanilla and how to create automated tests to make sure everything works out
